   enabling co-workers to argue about work, not food

Lunch is an application that co-workers can use to track their restaraunt preferences. Based on the likes and
dislikes of the people who will be going to lunch on a given day, the system will make the difficult decision
of which restaraunt a group should choose.

This application was designed to teach the process of creating a functioning ASP.NET MVC web application in 7
weeks. Each week (except for week 1) has a branch named Week2, Week3, etc. On that week, students can use git
to check out the given branch and follow the instructions found in the corresponding markdown file (i.e.
Week-1.md, Week-2.md, etc.). At the end of the lesson, the code should somewhat resemble the code that will
be found in the next week's branch. The master branch represents the completed project.

As stated in Week-1.md, in the first week you will create a new web application. There is no Week1 branch
because you are starting from scratch.
